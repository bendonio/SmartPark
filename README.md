# SmartPark
Project for the Internet of Things course of the MSc's degree in Computer Engineering at University of Pisa.

The project is about a smart park, exploiting presence sensors to count the number of occupied/free park slots, smart traffic lights to visually understand if the park is full, and flame detectors to react as fast as possible to a possible fire detected in the park.
